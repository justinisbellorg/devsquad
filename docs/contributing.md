# Introduction

## Welcome!

>Thanks for thinking about Contributing! I hope you do and that its a rewarding experience for you.


## This guide is important!

>Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing DevSquad. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

## How you can Contribute.

We are open to pretty much any kind of contribution. You can help triage issues, confirm bugs, or contribute code or new content! If you need help getting plugged in just join our discord server and join the #contributing channel!

# Ground Rules
## Behavior
>This is a welcoming inclusive environemnt. Everyone is welcome to help and we encourage people to contribute regardless of experience.
>Your Behavior trumps your talent.
>Please avoid any personal promotion in the product and discord except for the personal projects section.

## Responsibilities
> * Ensure cross-platform compatibility for every change that's accepted. Windows, Mac, Debian & Ubuntu Linux.
> * Ensure that code that goes into core meets all requirements in this checklist: **TBD
> * Keep changes small, preferably one feature or post per pull requests. The more pointed and specific your pull request, the easier it will get approved. 
> * Content should be drive as Markdown or Code, please no external integrations to a CRM or CMS.
> * Accesibility is king. Any UI updates or changes must maintain full accessilbity compatibility. 
> * Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds. Regardless of how good or bad a PR is, all feedback should be specific, contructive, and in no way comment on the person submitting the chage.
> * Content contributions should be focused on the mission of the site, please no political, religious, or personal commentary. If we wish to make such statements we will decide this as a group on our discord channel.


# Getting Started
Here are the easiest ways to get started, but feel free to jump in anywhere. 

> If you want to contribute code, check out our Beginner issues or Content issues as these should be the easiest.
> Use the site and create issues with either new feature suggestions or bugs. Bonus points if you find a bug and fix it yourself!
> Join the community. If you aren't sure where to start hop over to discord and join the covnersation there.


# Pull Requests
## Small Changes
>Create your own Fork of the Code
>Make your Changes.
>Run our linter and prettier against the project
>Each commit, if there is more than one, should have a clear desciption of what you are changing
>Your pull request should make it clear the change is small and what you changed. 

## Medium to Large Changes

>1. Create your own fork of the code
>2. Do the changes in your fork
>4. Be sure you have run eslint and prettier for the project along with a lighthouse check.
>5. Make it clear what your goal with the changes are, and how you feel it makes the project better.
>6. If you make a change that affects the entire site please note this and how you feel the site will be better. 
>7. If you are adding new content make sure you are adding it in the right space and please spellcheck and grammar check your work.
>8. If you want to make many changes and contributions please do not put them all in one pull request, each pull request should roughly be one feature.

# How to add an issue.
## Security
> If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Instead please report it on the Discord Channel or email the project email.

## Bugs

> When filing a bug, make sure to answer these five questions:
>
> 1. What version of the site are you using? You can find this in the package.json, if it is the live site check the branch tagged current.
> 2. What browser, browser version, operating system, and operating system version are you using. 
> 3. What did you do?
> 4. What did you expect to see?
> 5. What did you see instead?
>Please tag your issue as a bug.


## How to suggest new features
This information will give contributors context before they make suggestions that may not align with the projectâ€™s needs.

> The goal of DevSquad is to create tools to help developers manager their careers and work on the skills that help their marketability and in interviews. Please keep this in mind as you suggest new features.
>
> This is not a place for holy wars. Its great that you like XXXX better than what we use here. Feel free to suggest a change, but if it doesn't improve the site but instead suits your personal preferences, you probably won't have much luck.

## The Process
If you want to make small changes and improvements go ahead, no pre-approval required. If you want to add significant content, a complete new feature, or make bigger adjustments, please check in first. 

> Please check the #New Features Channel on discord to discuss new features and make suggestions. When one of the maintainers gives you the green light go ahead. If you do not follow this step, expect significantly more challenges on your PR.

# Code review process
## After you have submitted your PR

> For now while the project is small we will be having live code review sessions on discord where we will talk through the code, make comments and add suggestions. You can join in this session or feel free to wait for comments to come back to you. Small changes we will just quickly check over. 
> After feedback has been given we expect responses within two weeks. After two weeks we may close the pull request if it isn't showing any activity.

# Community
If you can't tell we use discord for most anything that isn't on github. Its open to join and there aren't any restricted channels except a few used by the maintainers for coordination stuff. All decisions and discussions around it will be made openly in a public space.
