# DevSquad
 DevSquad is an open source project designed to help software developers/engineers work on skills that help them grow their careers and prepare for interviews. It is an open source project where all of the content is hosted within the project itself. This is a great first project to contribute to and is meant to help folks get started in Open Source.

 While the Site itself is written in Next.Js there is no experience requirement for the site. You can contribute articles using Markdown, small code snippets, or CSS. We have invested a lot of time in making this project accessible to everyone. Even if you have never written code, this is a great place to learn and get started.

 This is also not a place aimed at having a bunch of holy wars. The goal is to help as many people as possible with fundamentals that will be helpful to as many different types of devs as possible. This is less focused on how to build projects or how to build a website. We might get into some of that, but the goal here is more focused on career skills and interview skills. 

 Some of the early content you will see will be focused on understanding common algorithms you might be asked to understand in a code interview, some basic skills to work well with other developrs and non technical stakeholders, and strategies for determining what skills to work on next. We plan to grow the project from there.

 Please jump in, contribute, and give us feedback!
